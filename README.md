# Programming and Scripting Labs (01–11)

This repository contains my solutions for Labs 01 to 11 of the **Programming and Scripting** module.  
Each lab focuses on practicing key Python concepts, from simple programs to working with files and objects.

## Labs Overview

### Lab 01 – Getting Started
- First Python programs, printing output, using variables.
- Learned about strings, numbers, and simple expressions.

### Lab 02 – First Programs & String Formatting
- Practiced writing basic programs.
- Used `input()` and formatted strings with f-strings.

### Lab 03 – Decisions (if statements)
- Learned how to use `if`, `elif`, and `else` for decision-making.
- Example: checking if a number is even/odd.

### Lab 04 – Loops
- Practiced `for` and `while` loops.
- Iterating over ranges and collections.

### Lab 05 – Data Structures
- Introduced lists, tuples, dictionaries.
- Accessing, updating, and looping through data structures.

### Lab 06 – Functions
- Defined and used functions with parameters and return values.
- Learned about scope and reusability.

### Lab 07 – Files
- Reading and writing text, CSV, and JSON files.
- Checked if files exist, used exception handling.

### Lab 08 – Plotting
- Worked with **matplotlib** to create simple plots.
- Example: line plots, histograms, scatter plots.

### Lab 09 – Numpy
- Introduced **numpy** arrays.
- Practiced array operations, generating random data.

### Lab 10 – Pandas
- Introduced **pandas** DataFrames.
- Read CSV files, explored data, used `.describe()`, `.head()`, and filtering.

### Lab 11 – Objects
- Created classes with `__init__` and `__str__`.
- Built a `TimesheetEntry` and `Employee` class.
- Logged time entries and calculated total minutes.
