# Lab 04 Extras â€“ Grade Program with Rounding and Loop

This version of the grade program includes:
- **Rounding**: Uses the `round()` function so percentages like 69.5 are rounded to 70.
- **Looping**: A `while` loop allows repeated percentage inputs until the user enters `-1` to quit.

## How it works
1. The program prompts the user to enter a percentage.
2. The percentage is rounded using `round()` before comparison.
3. The program checks the grade using `if`, `elif`, and `else`.
4. The loop continues until `-1` is entered.
